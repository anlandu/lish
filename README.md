# *lish*
This repo holds the code for the Javascript library *lish*.

This library has simple functionality. In the context of  a chrome extension, *lish* allows developers to wrap selections with tags (this base tag is a span tag, but his can easily be changed). It also hashes the content of the selection, giving the tag a class of that hash. This task may seem trivial and is if the selection is within just one tag, but it is more difficult if the selection spans multiple tags.

## Getting Started

* There are more files in this repository than those that need to be downloaded for *lish* to be used. The only file that you need to use the functionality is [selection.js](lib/selection.js) in the lib folder.
* Implement the file into your extentsion by making it a content script in your Manifest.Json. Fire the function 'getSelectionData' through a context menu to use the library.
* This repository is also an example of how to implement selection.js. Look through the code in the extension folder if you need help with Chrome Extensions. All of the code is well commented so it should help you getting started.

## Fun Facts

* The name *lish* comes from the last name of the famous literary editor Gordon Lish. As he was a literary editor, and this project has to do with editing the DOM, and the fact that he went to the same high-school I did, I named it after him.
