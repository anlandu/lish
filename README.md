# *lish*
This repo holds the publicly available code for the Javascript library *lish*.

The goal of this library to is to give developers the ability to make live changes to webpages not their own. Through a chrome extension, *lish* should allow for html elements to be superimposed onto any html file. Added elements would have hashes so they could be searched for and located.

#### Getting Started

*Lish*, as on now, is a still a work in progress. It is not a usable product at this moment.
